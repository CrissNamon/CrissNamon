+ RUVIK Messanger
    + RUVIK is android messanger, which uses my custom end-to-end encryption protocol. It consists of 3 parts: Server (Spring Boot), Client (Android), Encryption protocol (Ruvik Proto).
   <!-- + Server uses Spring Boot (Web, Security, Data JPA) with PostgreSQL DB as data storage and STOMP over Websocket for realtime messages
    + Client uses Android SDK with Retrofit, Room, RxAndroid
    + Ruvik Proto is simplified Signal protocol and uses AES, RSA, HMAC, Ratched -->
